- section: Background

  text: I am a first-generation college graduate. I was born in El Salvador and migrated to 
        the United States in 2009. 


        From a very young age, I have had an aptitude to learn and improve, be it science, mathematics or history. As I was born in a third world country I was not exposed to the many technological wonders that are available in more developed countries. It wasn't until I came to the U.S at the age of 11 that I was able to interact with my first computer. That sparked my enthusiasm for technology and innovation. Eventually, I was introduced to the internet and the power that technology has to shape the future and improve our lives. 


        Ever since, I have had the opportunity to learn thanks to the Internet. This has inspired me to be a contributing force for technological development. This was how I eventually became interested in Computer Science as a potential field of study.

  text: After high school, I sought a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). 


        Being self-taught and having no Computer Science classroom instruction prior to the start of my career at UCSB did not discourage me. I was determined to make my family proud and improve our standard of living. The road to obtain my degree was rewarding, with it's many ups and downs. It was thanks to my determination, friends and faculty that I got to where I am now.
        

        Now as a Computer Science graduate I feel blessed to have had this opportunity and proud to call myself a Gaucho!

  text: One of my favorite hobbies, like many others, is gaming. I mostly enjoy Nintendo games, such as Smash Bros, Mario and Zelda games. I'm also a big fan of Metroidvanias, my favorite being Hollow Knight.

        
        Another one of my hobbies, is fish keeping. I keep a 20 gallon tank at home filled with bright-colored guppies, Tetras, shrimps, snails and a pair of crabs. I find it relaxing to watch them swim around and go about their way. 


        On a more geeky front, I am a big fan of the Android Platform. I constantly follow and monitor all the new features added on every major release and changes to Android framework. I love to root Andoid phones for fun to tweak with the settings and customize devices to my liking. I also like to follow many of the crazy/incredible designs that Android phone manufacturers come up with and innovate to make the life of the average consummer easier. 


        Lastly, I love to learn about personal finance, more specifically the stock market. I enjoy following companies and what products they have down the pipeline and how the markets react to these news. Using technical analysis to find trends and make predictions is fun for me.
