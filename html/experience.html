				<div>SLO (Service Level Objective) Dashboard</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Led the frontend development for Redfin’s first SLO Dashboard from scratch, and since release, it has been used by every team at Redfin to visualize and tune their features’ SLOs.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Developed reusable React components and Reflux stores to propagate dynamic SLO data to datatables and graphs, while handling user interactions with the dashboard such as form submission and table filtering.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Utilized asynchronous data calls and request versioning to speed up the SLO dashboard page load by 7x, and drastically improved its usability as more SLOs were getting onboarded.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Implemented a code design pattern for managing nested React forms, in an effort to break down responsibilities of the main React store into multiple single-purpose ones and increase code readability.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Iterated on user/engineer feedbacks after the release to stabilize the platform and enhance its accessibility to all users.</div>



				<div>
					SLO Ingestion Pipeline</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Independently investigated into a missing data issue with the SLO data ingestion pipeline, and the solution permanently fixed 30 problematic SLOs and increased ingestion accuracy for many others.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Developed a data verification job in JavaScript that runs alongside the SLO data ingestion job, as it periodically verifies, reports, and re-ingests if any missing data is detected in the pipeline.</div>



				<div>
					Elasticsearch (Logging Platform) Disk Quota Program</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Designed a Python program that automatically controls disk usage for each logging service, saving hours of oncall time each week trying to prevent machines from running out of disk.</div>



				<div class="indent">
					❖ Developed Python scripts to aggregate disk usage data from Elasticsearch API, auto-delete log indices based on the quota configuration, and report important metrics to monitor the disk health for each service and the logging platform.</div>
